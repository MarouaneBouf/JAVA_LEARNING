<h3>Accessing an element</h3>
<p>Unfortunetly, we cannot use the regular indexing tool aka <del>brackets</del>>but instead we use .get() method.</p>

<h3>Modifying</h3>
<p>Unfortunetly, we cannot modifying an element using the regular = tool but instead we use .set() method.</p>

<h3>Removing</h3>
<p>This one is pretty coo, we can actually remove an element from the list by it's actual key or by its index !!! coool</p>
